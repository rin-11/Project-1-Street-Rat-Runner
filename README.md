# Project-1-Street-Rat-Runner


My game is a canvas style player running game.

The user plays as a rat and has to use the left, right, and up key to get through the streets while avoiding coliding with cats, traps, and poison.

The goal is to make it through the game in two minutes without getting a score higher than 500.






Proposal Goals (MVP)
-Have the rat moving through the street for 10 blocks
-Create health metric which loses LP when the rat runs into a cat and automatically is game over when the rat runs into a trap or poison. When the rat eats -garbage it gains LP back.


Proposal Goals (Stretch)
--Make three levels (easy/medium//hard) which determines how frequent the rat could run into cats/poison/traps.
